# Sentimental-Analysis

This project was done for the Fundamentals of Data Science course and deals with sentiment analysis of text.  
The goal is: given a text, predict if the emotion is positive or negative.

Here the description of each file:
<lu>
<li><b>FDS_final.pdf :</b> All the theoretical aspect of the project, the tests, the decision we made and the final observation. </li>
<li><b>FDS_final.ipynb :</b>The code, with a description for each piece of code.</li>
<li><b>FDS_Project_webapp :</b>In this directory you'll find a little application to run locally. The only thing you have to do is to enter in the repository and run "python runserver.py" (more information into the read.me file in the directory)</li>
</lu>

Have fun! P.S. This is an output example:
